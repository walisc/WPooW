In WordPress they are ways to access/manipulate the data saved in your database. These methods can be used to access the data
saved by the declared WPooW PageTypes'. The WPooW library does however provide wrapper methods you can use with your declared PageTypes to access the data,  making
 it easier to access the data saved through a declared WPooW PageType.
