**wpAPI vs wpOOW?**

If you have had a good eye reading through this documentation you would have noticed that the code examples refer to
 wpAPI quite a bit. wpAPI and wpOOW are the same thing.

 When started this project, I called it what I thought at the time, best described it - an API. As it grew,
 I began to reflect on the name and the fact that in the WordPress community
  the WordPress API referred to it's restful API's. Through this process I renamed the project to wpOOW (the WordPress
  object oriented wrapper) which I thought better represented what the library was and would not conflict with the already
  existing WordPress restful API.

  Of course with such changes, legacy code is not always immediately replaced, hence you have this scenario. Version
  2.0 will rectify this however.

**Shout Out!**

I would also like give a shout out the Alessandro Castellani and his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/williamprey) which helped give me an overview of all that
was possible in creating custom themes/plugins. Do checkout his channel for great WordPress tutorial videos.
